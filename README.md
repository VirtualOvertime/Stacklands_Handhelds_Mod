# Handhelds

A Stacklands mod that adds cards based on popular handheld gaming devices.

### Current List:
- Nintendo Game Boy
- Nintendo 3DS
- PlayStation Portable
- Nintendo Switch
- Steam Deck
- Playdate

You can find the handhelds in random places -- each handheld is assigned a card bag type. The Game Boy is in BasicResources, and all the rest are in AdvancedResources. One example of where you can find these handhelds are in booster packs.

When you get a handheld, the only real purpose it to sell them for their value, of which is different for each handheld.

Eventually, I'll give the cards more purpose, and this mod will be less cosmetic.
I may add more handhelds in the future.
